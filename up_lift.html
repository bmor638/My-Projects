<p align ="center" font size="5">&nbsp;Hello everyone! Welcome to my gallery, a little project that I have been working on for the past couple days.<br>
Since the beginning of my AP Computer Science Principles class this year, I have developed a love for coding. And, with
some newly acquired time, I decided to create something that would combine my excitement for coding, my love of art, and my desire to make a positive impact on the world around me.</p>
<p align="center" font size="5">With the corona virus, it seems like the world is coming to an abrupt halt with more and more stores and gatherings closing each day. In the midst of it all,
however, I hope that this gallery can shed some light upon your life.</p>
<p align="center" font size="5">&nbsp;I have titled this project "upLIFT" as a reminder that, no matter where we are in life,
we can all make a difference on this world by lifting each other up. It doesn't take a whole lot to create a positive impact, and each of us individually have more power
than we know in terms of making a difference on our communities.<br>Although I do not know where I will take this gallery in the future, I am beyond excited to share it with you now. I hope you enjoy!
<br>- Beckett M.<br><br></p>

<p align="center" font size="5">My first collection! I am so excited for these pieces! It took me a while to select the quotations that I have chosen because I have so many that I love, 
so I hope you find inspiration from them. I do not have a specific theme for this collection, but I do hope that these four pieces can give you a snapshot of my vision 
for this gallery.<br>So, at long last, here is Collection 0: The Beginnings. :)</p>

<p align="center" font size="+5">Aligning with the title of my gallery, here is Collection 1: Uplift! Like I mentioned at the beginning
of this gallery as I introduced my goal for this project, I believe that some much good can come from supporting one another and doing our best everyday
to lift each other up. With this collection, I challenge you to make it a goal to do something everyday, no matter how simple, to lift someone around you up.
<br>Here it is, Collection 1: Uplift! :)</p>

<p align="center" font size="5">As I looked for inspiration from my quote collection for the next focus of this gallery, gratitude continuously 
came up. And, as I have grown to value gratitude as an integral part of my life, as it should be, I decided that it would be fitting
to create Collection 2: Gratitude.<br>I hope you find joy in these pieces! :)</p>
